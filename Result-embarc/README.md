# Roadmap for the *embarc* data analysis

### Step 0: data description 

1. demographic table
2. trajectory plot
3. statistical tests

### Step 1: randomly choose two covariates

Age + Severity

Step 1.1: without orthognal tranformation

Step 1.2: with orthgonal transformation 

### Step 2: randomly choose three covariates

Step 2.1: without orthognal tranformation

Step 2.2: with orthgonal transformation 

### Step 3: combine all the categorical variables as one variable

Step 3.1: without orthognal tranformation

Step 3.2: with orthgonal transformation 

As we know, when W is larger, the difference is larger, how about use the same W, which is the max W?

### Plots 

1. trajectory plots
2. boundary plot 
3. table 
4. ellipse

however, the boundary plots are too ugly.

try use the previous codes
