## To do list

1. Derivate the relationship of X^TX = (X-mu)^T D^{-1} (X-mu)

   (done, however, cannot to see the regular)
   
   but do not change the covariates matirxm, the type of curve do not change. 
   
2. Purity.
   
   puirty for each subjects, whether or not conditioning on the covariates. 
   kernel smoothing maybe? estimate the p(w), do not treat it as a uniform distribution. 
   
3. Boundary plot

   go back to the previous boudnary plot, figure out why it changed the type of the curve? 
   
   how about if we just separate them into two groups? will the results consistent to want we think?
