## MEETING SEP 23

TO DO LIST

1. derivation
   + previous method we could get a close form of purity. however, the derivation doesn't makes a lot of sense.        maybe we could treat beta gamma and D as the function of alpha and use chain rule
   + we get another form of purity, calculate the integral
   
2. plot
   + more bars in the histogram
   
3. If the optim function runs too slow, maybe we can consider the taylor expension and get the first or second order? 

4. Embarc dataset 
   + use one covariate each time to calculate the purity
   + use 3 or 4 to calculate the purity
   + the purity by each one of the covariates should be smaller than the combination of the covariates
   
5. Iteration? talked last time
   + given the best alpha, we can get the hat beta, gamma and d
   + given the hat beta, gamma, and d, we can get the best alpha
